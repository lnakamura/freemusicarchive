independent international record label based in Moscow since 2002. It
is created by musicians and for musicians, operates on behalf of the
member-artists and has complete control over the releases. It advocates
distinctive, challenging and deviant music in a wide range of genres
and styles including &lt;b&gt;avant-garde, experimental, instrumental, progressive, psychedelic &amp;amp; doom&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RAIG aims to release what we think is music that otherwise might not
be heard. We produce limited releases on CD, and only on exclusive
basis. Any profits made are put back into the label and the growing
roster of artists. We are also believers in creative artwork and
packaging – we think that a release is not just about the music, it is
the whole presentation of it. To make a true piece of art from the
musical work, we collaborate with many Russian artists, photographers,
and designers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RAIG also operates &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raig.ru/AT.asp&quot;&gt;the Accessory Takes net-label&lt;/a&gt; which offers free-to-download mp3-releases by label artists and friends; and maintains &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raig.ru/distro.asp&quot;&gt;the online store&lt;/a&gt; which functions as a regular Russian language webzine.

population as well as the record stores which helped launch the Rai music explosion of the mid 80's. 
&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt; Owned and operated by two French musicians and long-time 
                          Brooklyn residents, Barbès functions as a neighborhood 
                          community center of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt; Much like the neighborhood it is named after, Barbès 
                          puts the stress on cultural variety, neighborhood conviviality 
                          - and bargain hunting , with $6 Ricard and an eclectic 
                          music collection which ranges from the Lebanese diva 
                          &lt;span class=&quot;italic&quot;&gt;Asmahan&lt;/span&gt; to Mexican &lt;span class=&quot;italic&quot;&gt;bandas&lt;/span&gt;, 
                          Venezuelan &lt;span class=&quot;italic&quot;&gt;joropos&lt;/span&gt; and Romanian 
                          brass bands. &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Our
bar has one of the best selection of Single Malt Scotch in the city as
well as twelve beer on draft, top notch Tequilas, Slivovitz, Pastis
cocktails, Japanese Single Malt, Italian digestive and an extensive
choice of bottled beer. &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Our performance space in our intimate back room, is 
                          host to regular events - music, readings and film screenings 
                          (see our &lt;a href=&quot;http://barbesbrooklyn.com/calendar.html&quot; class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;calendar&lt;/a&gt; page) and  fills a gap in a neighborhood which 
                          is home to a large population of artists, musicians, 
                          and writers but still offers  little in terms of 
                        performing outlets &lt;/p&gt;</curator_bio><curator_favorites>11</curator_favorites><curator_comments>0</curator_comments><curator_playlists>0</curator_playlists><curator_date_created>1/08/2010 01:50:07 AM</curator_date_created></value><value><curator_id>1000</curator_id><curator_handle>CPDP</curator_handle><curator_url>http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/CPDP/</curator_url><curator_site_url>http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu</curator_site_url><curator_image_file>http://freemusicarchive.org/file/images/curators/Cylinder_Preservation_and_Digitization_Project_-_20110502164320371.png</curator_image_file><curator_type>curator</curator_type><curator_title>Cylinder Preservation and Digitization Project</curator_title><curator_tagline/><curator_bio>&lt;p&gt;A digital collection of recordings held by the University of California at Santa Barbara.

The database grew out of the original Anthology of Recorded Music project which, in 1976, released a set of 100 LPs of American music to libraries all over America in celebration of the U.S. Bicentennial.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In keeping with that spirit, DRAM features some of the work of America's most important contemporary composers and performers, including Robert Ashley, Phill Niblock, Pauline Oliveros, Elliott Carter and others through partnerships with such labels as Mode, XI, Pogus, Lovely, Deep Listening, Firehouse 12, Porter, Edition Wandelweiser, B-Boim, Albany, New World Records, CRI, and others...as well as a growing number of recordings brought on through archival preservation and curation, including upcoming archives from Niblock's Experimental Intermedia, early Sun Ra recordings curated by John Corbett, live performances from Mills College, and Ben Hall's amazing collection of Southern Gospel 45s with an introductory essay by Rick Moody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DRAM, which has only been available to college libraries until now, is exploring options for individual subscription to have streaming access to all the great music featured here.

&lt;p&gt;For the past decade an alternative culture of music has been sprouting up outside the wastelands of the increasingly formulaic and compartmentalized mainstream music business. This world of “Netaudio” is generally released freely, either independently or through Netlabels. As this culture continues to grow, the amount of available music grows exponentially making it increasingly difficult for folks who are new to the culture to filter the good from the bad. Each of our free releases, in one way or another, are an attempt to shine the spotlight on what we think is the best of what this world has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider blocSonic a filter through which you can discover this vibrant, global culture! Currently there are three ways which we spotlight what the netaudio world has to offer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blocsonic.com/releases/type/originals&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Originals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our travels through the wide-world of netaudio culture, we find artists who stand out and who we feel would be perfect to spotlight independently in original blocSonic album releases. Each Original features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Available in a choice of three high-quality audio formats — &lt;a href=&quot;http://flac.sourceforge.net/faq.html#general__what_is&quot;&gt;Lossless FLAC&lt;/a&gt;, 320kbs MP3 and 192kbs MP3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete album art is available in three formats — EPS, PDF and TIF.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40+ page PDF booklet with complete liner-notes, lyrics, photos and album credits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blocsonic.com/releases/type/xtended-editions&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt; Xtended Editions &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of our Xtended Edition (XE) series is essentially a re-release. A re-release of an album that blocSonic found to be an exceptional example of the quality that the netaudio world is capable of producing. These re-releases contain the original album as well as at least a bonus disc worth of material (remixes, demos, outtakes, new material and/or other unreleased material). They also feature fresh album art and as with all our releases an extensive PDF booklet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each Xtended Edition features: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;At least 1 disc worth of bonus material&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Available in a choice of three high-quality audio formats — &lt;a href=&quot;http://flac.sourceforge.net/faq.html#general__what_is&quot;&gt;Lossless FLAC&lt;/a&gt;, 320kbs MP3 and 192kbs MP3.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Complete new album art is available in three formats — EPS, PDF and TIF.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;40+ page PDF booklet with complete liner-notes, lyrics, photos and album credits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blocsonic.com/releases/type/netblocs&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;netBlocs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these eclectic releases shine a spotlight on ten or so international audio gems culled from the Netaudio culture. Each netBloc features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Available in a choice of three high-quality audio formats — &lt;a href=&quot;http://flac.sourceforge.net/faq.html#general__what_is&quot;&gt;Lossless FLAC&lt;/a&gt;, 320kbs MP3 and 192kbs MP3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete album art is available in three formats — EPS, PDF and TIF.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30+ page PDF booklet with complete liner-notes, track credits and artist photos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blocsonic.com/releases/type/xtras&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Xtras&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These special collections feature Creative Commons licensed tracks that for one reason or another blocSonic couldn't acquire official permission to use but find them worthy of extra attention. Since no formal permission has been acquired, links to the original files are provided rather than compiling them into a proper release. However, a cover and a tracklisting is provided in order for you to burn them to disc, if you'd like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we do what we do? We love music, we love netaudio and have found that the quality and variety of what’s coming out of this culture is superior to that of much of what’s coming out of the mainstream music industry. We feel more secure donating to netaudio artists/labels then we do purchasing formulaic music-product from the majors. We’d like you to also feel that way toward the netaudio culture. We realize that most people don’t have the time and/or patience to filter through it all to find the good stuff, so we invest the time to find the gems in the ruff and deliver them to you in our releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In between releases, you can also look forward to blog posts about netaudio news or topics relating to DRM and online music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So subscribe to our &lt;a href=&quot;http://blocsonic.com/feed&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; and discover great new openly-licensed music every month.

It was created because of the belief in the power of art and the art process to have a positive impact in the life of these young people. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Times;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;AS220 Youth offers free classes and workshops in three locations – our downtown Studio, at the Rhode Island Youth Development Center (the state’s juvenile detention facility), and at UCAP, the Urban Collaborative Accelerated Program. UCAP is a middle school for youth at high risk for dropping out and/or becoming involved in the juvenile justice system. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Times;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;.At our downtown Studio, after-school  workshops run 6 days a week, including photo, painting/drawing, hiphop, music lessons, dance, creative writing, sewing and computer-aided design. Similar classes taught by the same instructors are offered at the Youth Development Center (YDC)  and at UCAP, with the goal of creating strong mentoring relationships between instructors and students. Curriculum is designed so youth can start a class at the YDC and continue it at AS220 after release. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Times;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;At the end of each term, there are showcases where youth get to exhibit/perform the work created in their workshops. In addition, youth develop portfolios of their creative work, and these can be used to gain educational and employment opportunities.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</curator_bio><curator_favorites>1</curator_favorites><curator_comments>0</curator_comments><curator_playlists>0</curator_playlists><curator_date_created>2/19/2010 07:25:28 PM</curator_date_created></value><value><curator_id>21</curator_id><curator_handle>Halasam</curator_handle><curator_url>http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/Halasam/</curator_url><curator_site_url>http://halas.am</curator_site_url><curator_image_file>http://freemusicarchive.org/file/images/curators/Halasam_-_20111121144608969.jpg</curator_image_file><curator_type>curator</curator_type><curator_title>Halas.am</curator_title><curator_tagline>HolonArtLabAudioService AM</curator_tagline><curator_bio>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HALAS Radio&lt;/b&gt; is a non-profit internet radio station broadcasting from The Israeli Center for Digital Art in Holon, Israel.
